1 What is WipeFreeSpace?
************************

This program is used for secure erasing of free space on ext2, ext3,
ext4, NTFS, XFS, ReiserFSv3, ReiserFSv4, FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, MinixFSv1,
MinixFSv2, JFS, HFS+ and OCFS partitions.

   WipeFreeSpace wipes the following things (when supported by the
backing library):
   * free space (space in unused blocks/clusters)
   * free space in partially used blocks (also called the "slack space")
   * deleted files' names and other data that can be used to undelete a
     file (like the journal)
   WipeFreeSpace does *NOT* decrease the amount of available free space
when working.

   Normally, when you delete a file, only the information about where
the file was is deleted, the file contents stays on the drive.  If
there's no writing to that area, the file can physically stay on the
drive for a long time.  The file contents can be found by e.g.  dumping
the whole drive with the 'dd' program to a file and looking at the
generated image.  This may seem not so dangerous, but if you delete
confidential information (files with passwords, credit card numbers,
encryption keys), any person with physical access to the drive can read
that information and use it against you.

   *ALWAYS USE THE 'shred' (or similar) PROGRAM TO ERASE CONFIDENTIAL
DATA.*

   Sometimes you may delete confidential data the normal way by accident
(or have no other choice, because programs like Internet browsers, mail
clients, chat clients delete data the normal way).  In such case
normally you would have to shred the whole partition, which may be a big
problem.  This is where WipeFreeSpace comes in.  This program works in a
similar way to the 'shred' program, but instead of shredding regular
files, it overwrites (just like 'shred') the free space on a partition,
without doing any harm to existing files.  The wiped blocks are *NOT*
marked as used at any stage.

   This program also tries to wipe the remaining space in blocks
partially used by existing files and wipe deleted elements' names.

   *NOTE*: The program's operations are limited by:
   * the capabilities of the filesystem-specific library that is used
     (*note Filesystems support::)
   * the mounting of the filesystem being wiped (filesystems mounted in
     read+write mode will not be wiped, due to data safety reasons)
   * the permissions granted by the operating system, like mounting a
     read+write filesystem with a loop device in read-only mode still
     doesn't allow it to be wiped
   * the operating system's limits (like memory)

   *THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN TESTED, BUT IT MAY NOW OR LATER CONTAIN ERRORS,
WHICH MAY LEAD TO DATA LOSS. ALWAYS BACKUP YOUR DATA BEFORE USING THIS
PROGRAM. READ THE LICENSE FOR A WARRANTY (THERE IS NONE).*

   *NOTE*: The program will refuse operating if it finds out that it has
the suid permission bit set and the owner is root.  PLEASE, NEVER do
such a thing.  If the program is exploited, it can do severe damage to
the system.  Log in as root and run the program.  If you really must run
the program as a normal user, set the sgid bit instead and correct the
necessary device/file permissions.  This is *MUCH* safer.

2 How to compile the program?
*****************************

Requirements for compiling the full version of the program:
   * a working C compiler.  XFS, ReiserFS, Reiser4 and NTFS support
     require the 'long long' data type.  NTFS support may require the
     'gcc' compiler.  C++ compilers won't work due to variable casts.
   * development package for the C library (like glibc-devel and
     glibc-headers).
   * the 'make' program
   * the requirements introduced by the filesystem backends (*note
     Filesystems support::)

   Type

   './configure'

   to configure the program for your system.

   If you do not wish support for a filesystem, give the
'--enable-FS=no' option to './configure' (FS=EXT234, NTFS, XFS,
REISERFS, REISER4, FAT, MINIX, JFS, HFSP, OCFS).

   If you do not wish support for a particular wiping operation, give
the '--enable-OPER=no' option to './configure' (OPER=wfs, unrm, part -
these are wiping free space, undelete data and partially-used blocks,
respectively).  You cannot disable all of these.

   Run './configure --help' for details.

   If you do *NOT* wish WipeFreeSpace to use the network or get the
computer's IP address, get LibHideIP>=0.2
(https://libhideip.sourceforge.io) and LibNetBlock
(https://libnetblock.sourceforge.io) and configure WipeFreeSpace with

   './configure --enable-LIBHIDEIP --enable-LIBNETBLOCK'

   *NOTE*: this may cause network filesystem wiping to fail.

   Type

   'make'

   to compile the program.

   Documentation is compiled, but may be recompiled, if you have the
'makeinfo' program ('texinfo' package).  Translations will be compiled,
if you have the 'gettext' package.

   *NOTE*: if you have trouble compiling, send me:
  1. the compiler name and version (e.g.  'gcc version 10'),
  2. the C standard library name and version (e.g.  'glibc version
     2.x'),
  3. the output of the 'configure' script.  You can capture it by
     running './configure > configure-output.txt 2>&1',
  4. the generated 'config.log' file,
  5. the generated 'config.h' file, if it exists,
  6. the output of the 'make' command.  You can capture it by running
     'make > make-output.txt 2>&1',
  7. any other error messages,
  8. any other information that you think could lead to solving the
     problem.

   Type

   'make install'

   to install the program.

   *NOTE*: 'make install' is *NOT* recommended.  Create and install an
RPM package instead, if possible.

   To create an RPM package:

  1. copy the 'wipefreespace.spec' file to '$HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS'
  2. copy the source package 'wipefreespace-2.6.tar.gz' to
     '$HOME/rpmbuild/SOURCES'
  3. type 'rpmbuild -bb $HOME/rpmbuild/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec'
  4. get the RPMs from '$HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/your_cpu_arch'

   To create an RPM package (the old way):

  1. copy the 'wipefreespace.spec' file to '/usr/src/redhat/SPECS'
  2. copy the source package 'wipefreespace-2.6.tar.gz' to
     '/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES'
  3. type 'rpmbuild -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/wipefreespace.spec'
  4. get the RPMs from '/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/your_cpu_arch'

   *NOTE*: some systems may use other directories than these.

3 Filesystems support
*********************

This chapter describes the requirements to compile the various
filesystem backends and the operations supported by them.

   *NOTE*: WipeFreeSpace tries to wipe partially used blocks only in
regular files on the filesystem.  It may print errors (short reads) or
crash on sparse files and other exotic objects.  Printing an error is
normal in such case.  WipeFreeSpace may also print an error if there
were no objects suitable for wiping - this also is a normal situation
meant to inform the user.

File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: Ext2/3/4,  Next: NTFS,  Prev: Filesystems support,  Up: Filesystems support

3.1 Ext2/3/4
============

Support: native, working libraries from 'e2fsprogs' / 'libext2fs'.

   Compiling requirements:
   * development package for the ext2 file system library, 'libext2fs'
     (usually included in something like 'e2fsprogs-devel').  If you
     don't have anything like this installed or available (check twice),
     then go to
     <http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/>
     Then compile and install that package.  Ext4 support requires new
     enough versions, like 1.41.

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks (*NOTE*: may print
     errors on sparse files and other exotic objects)
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks), wiping deleted files' names and setting deleted files'
     names' lengths once to zero
   * wiping the journal


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: NTFS,  Next: XFS,  Prev: Ext2/3/4,  Up: Filesystems support

3.2 NTFS
========

Support: 'libntfs' / 'ntfs-3g': not official - not written by the
filesystem's creators, written without any specifications.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'long long' data type support in the compiler
   * the development package for the NTFS file system library,
     'ntfs3g-ntfsprogs'.
     If you don't have anything like this installed or available (check
     twice), then go to
     <http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/>

     Then compile and install that package.  You can also use 'libntfs'
     (usually included in something like 'ntfsprogs-devel').

   The shipped patches for ntfsprogs are optional.  Whether or not they
will be included in the official release of ntfsprogs, WipeFreeSpace
still will compile.

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks (in files exceeding
     i-node size)
   * wiping deleted files' names, deleted files' names' lengths (wiping,
     not zeroing once), wiping deleted files' data (part of free space
     or partially used blocks)
   * wiping the journal
   * running the dedicated wiping tool, 'ntfswipe'


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: XFS,  Next: ReiserFSv3,  Prev: NTFS,  Up: Filesystems support

3.3 XFS
=======

Support: only supported by executing 'xfs_db' from 'xfsprogs', because I
haven't found any usable development library.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'unistd.h' header
   * the 'fcntl.h' header
   * the 'mntent.h' header
   * the 'wait.h' header or 'sys/wait.h' (not required, actually, but a
     good thing to have)
   * the 'sched.h' header (not required, actually, but a good thing to
     have)
   * the 'paths.h' header (not required, actually, but a good thing to
     have)
   * the 'fork()' function
   * the 'execvp()' function
   * the 'dup2()' function
   * the 'close()' function
   * the 'pipe()' function
   * the 'kill()' function
   * the 'waitpid()' or 'wait()' function
   * the 'sleep()' function (not required, actually, but a good thing to
     have)
   * the 'long long' data type support in the compiler
   * 'xfsprogs' installed and in your 'PATH' variable (devel package
     unusable, so not required).  Can be downloaded from
     <https://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/xfs/xfsprogs/> (previous
     address: 'http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/')

     Compile and install that package.  The following utilities should
     be available: 'xfs_db', 'xfs_freeze', 'xfs_unfreeze'.  The 'xfs_db'
     program should support the following command-line options: '-i',
     '-c' and the following interactive mode commands: 'quit', 'freesp
     -d', 'blockget -n', 'ncheck', 'sb 0', 'print'.  Version 2.7.11 is
     enough, earlier versions will probably also work.

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: ReiserFSv3,  Next: ReiserFSv4,  Prev: XFS,  Up: Filesystems support

3.4 ReiserFSv3
==============

Support: using the library from 'reiserfsprogs', but that library is not
a part of any official development package.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'unistd.h' with 'wait.h' header or 'sys/wait.h'
   * the 'mntent.h' (with at least one of its functions - 'getmntent()'
     or 'getmntent_r()')
   * the 'fork()' function
   * the 'waitpid()' or 'wait()' function
   * the 'long long' data type support in the compiler
   * the development package for reiserfsprogs (header files - '*.h' -
     and compiled static libraries - '*.a' - from the package).

     If you're having trouble compiling, try to apply the patch first:
     'patch -F10 -p1 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX-compile-fix.diff'

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and ReiserFSv4 are enabled, the program
may refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line
option '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' that makes the linker accept multiple symbol
definitions.  If you have this problem, disable the support for either
of these filesystems (you can compile two versions of the program).
Don't complain to me, complain to the guys that made 'reiserfsprogs' and
'reiser4progs'.
You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/misc_mntent/new_misc_mntent/g' '{}'
\;'

   in the root directory of either 'reiserfsprogs' or 'reiser4progs'
(but *NOT* both, because this would bring back the same problem, but
with a different name).  Type the command as above, just without the
leading and trailing apostrophes.  The command must be run *BEFORE*
compiling the reiserfs programs.  You can use the provided patches to do
this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser4-1.0.7.diff'

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and MinixFS are enabled, the program
may refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line
option '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' that makes the linker accept multiple symbol
definitions.  If you have this problem, disable the support for either
of these filesystems (you can compile two versions of the program).
You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/die/new_die/g' '{}' \;'

   in the root directory of either 'reiserfsprogs' or 'mfstool' (but
*NOT* both, because this would bring back the same problem, but with a
different name).  Type the command as above.  The command must be run
*BEFORE* compiling 'reiserfs'/'mfstool'.  You can use the provided
patches to do this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/mfstool-0.5.diff'

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and JFS are enabled, you *MUST* either
disable the support for either of these filesystems (you can compile two
versions of the program) or fix the ReiserFSv3 library yourself, by
running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/bread/reiser3_new_bread/g' '{}' \;'

   in the root directory of 'reiserfsprogs'.  Type the command as above.
The command must be run *BEFORE* compiling 'reiserfs'/'jfsutils'.  You
can use the provided patches to do this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   Even if your linker/compiler accepts the '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' option,
it won't help in this case.

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks, but only if the block
     has just 1 item, and limited to 2^32 blocks
   * wiping deleted files' names
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)
   * wiping the journal

3.5 ReiserFSv4
==============

Support: using the library from 'reiser4progs-devel'.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'mntent.h' (with at least one of its functions - 'getmntent()'
     or 'getmntent_r()')
   * the 'long long' data type support in the compiler
   * development package for 'reiser4progs', 'libuuid' ('e2fsprogs' or
     'e2fsprogs-libs') and libaal.  Go to
     <http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/fs/reiser4/>
     and
     <http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/>
     to get the libraries.  After installing, 'libmisc.a' needs to be
     copied in the same place as 'libreiser4.a', but under a different
     name - 'libreiser4misc.a':

     'cp libmisc/.libs/libmisc.a /usr/lib/libreiser4misc.a'

     'libmisc.a' is in 'reiser4progs', of course.  Nobody thought it
     would be needed, but 'libreiser4.a' is useless without it.
     Substitute the correct destination path for your system in the
     above command.

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and ReiserFSv4 are enabled, the program
may refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line
option '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' that makes the linker accept multiple symbol
definitions.  If you have this problem, disable the support for either
of these filesystems (you can compile two versions of the program).
Don't complain to me, complain to the guys that made 'reiserfsprogs' and
'reiser4progs'.
You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/misc_mntent/new_misc_mntent/g' '{}'
\;'

   in the root directory of either 'reiserfsprogs' or 'reiser4progs'
(but *NOT* both, because this would bring back the same problem, but
with a different name).  Type the command as above, just without the
leading and trailing apostrophes.  The command must be run *BEFORE*
compiling the reiserfs programs.  You can use the provided patches to do
this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser4-1.0.7.diff'

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space)
   * wiping the journal


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: FAT12/16/32,  Next: MinixFS,  Prev: ReiserFSv4,  Up: Filesystems support

3.6 FAT12/16/32
===============

Support: 'tffs-lib': not official - not written by the filesystem's
creators, written without any specifications.

   Compiling requirements:
   * 'tffs-lib', the Tiny FAT FS library.  Go to
     <https://github.com/likema/tffs-lib>
     to get the library (former address:
     'http://code.google.com/p/tffs-lib/').  To make WipeFreeSpace work
     faster, apply the patch that removes synchronising the filesystem
     from TFFS (WipeFreeSpace does its own synchronising):

     'patch -F10 -p0 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/tffs-speed.diff'

     If you experience crashes (especially on 64-bit systems), you may
     try to apply these patches as well:

     'patch -F10 -p0 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/tffs-free-fix.diff'

     'patch -F10 -p0 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/tffs-overflow-fix.diff'

     'patch -F10 -p0 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/tffs-fat-eof-fix.diff'

     'patch -F10 -p0 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/tffs-dir-fix.diff'

     After applying any patch, you need to recompile and install the
     library - 'libtffs.a' - and ALL its header - '*.h' - files
     (including the private ones, from the 'src' directory).

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks (*NOTE*: may crash on
     sparse files and other exotic objects)
   * wiping deleted files' names (at least the short ones)
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)

   *NOTE*: the original TFFS library does its own data flushing (in the
'HAI_writesector()' function), so even when WipeFreeSpace is told to
perform just one wiping iteration (which uses the system/drive cache on
other filesystems and doesn't flush the data immediately), the data is
flushed after each sector, which makes FAT12/16/32 wiping really slow.

   *NOTE*: filesystems with object names of length 64 or more may cause
problems with traversal and thus may not be fully wiped (if a file can't
be opened, its last block can't be wiped, if a directory can't be
opened, objects inside it can't be wiped).


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: MinixFS,  Next: JFS,  Prev: FAT12/16/32,  Up: Filesystems support

3.7 MinixFS
===========

Support: using the 'mfstool' program unofficially as a library.

   Compiling requirements:
   * 'mfstool', the MinixFS tool.  Go to
     <http://mfstool.sourceforge.net/>
     to get this program.  Before compiling, perform:

     'sed -i 's/opt_squash/0/g' `ls *.c | egrep -v main`'

     then compile the program ('./configure && make'), then perform

     'ar surf libminixfs.a `ls *.o | egrep -v main`'

     Then copy the files 'libminixfs.a', 'minix_fs.h' and 'protos.h' to
     a directory where the C compiler can find them (or put the correct
     '-I' and '-L' options in the compiler flags).  You can use the
     provided patches to do this instead of the 'sed' command:

     'patch -F10 -p1 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/mfstool-0.5.diff'

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and MinixFS are enabled, the program
may refuse to link if the compiler doesn't support the command line
option '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' that makes the linker accept multiple symbol
definitions.  If you have this problem, disable the support for either
of these filesystems (you can compile two versions of the program).
You can fix either of these libraries yourself, by running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/die/new_die/g' '{}' \;'

   in the root directory of either 'reiserfsprogs' or 'mfstool' (but
*NOT* both, because this would bring back the same problem, but with a
different name).  Type the command as above.  The command must be run
*BEFORE* compiling 'reiserfs'/'mfstool'.  You can use the provided
patches to do this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 < /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/mfstool-0.5.diff'

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space, limited to 2^32 blocks
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks
   * wiping deleted files' names
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)

3.8 JFS
=======

Support: using the unofficial library from 'jfsuitls'.

   Compiling requirements:
   * 'jfsutils' and 'libuuid' (the 'uuid/uuid.h' header file).  Go to
     <http://jfs.sourceforge.net/>
     to get 'jfsutils'.  'Libuuid' can be a part of 'util-linux' or
     'util-linux-ng', which can be found on the kernel site:
     <http://kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/>
     or as a part of 'e2fsprogs' available at
     <http://e2fsprogs.sf.net/>.

     Compile 'jfsutils', then copy all the 'jfs_*.h' header files from
     the 'include' subdirectory and the 'libfs.a' file to a directory
     where the C compiler can find them (or put the correct '-I' and
     '-L' options in the compiler flags).

     If you're having trouble compiling, try to apply the patch first:
     'patch -F10 -p1 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/jfsutils-1.1.11-compile-fix.diff'

   *WARNING*: If both ReiserFSv3 and JFS are enabled, you *MUST* either
disable the support for either of these filesystems (you can compile two
versions of the program) or fix the ReiserFSv3 library yourself, by
running

   'find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/bread/reiser3_new_bread/g' '{}' \;'

   in the root directory of 'reiserfsprogs'.  Type the command as above.
The command must be run *BEFORE* compiling 'reiserfs'/'jfsutils'.  You
can use the provided patches to do this:

   'patch -F10 -p1 <
/path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/reiser-3.6.XX.diff'

   Even if your linker/compiler accepts the '-Wl,-z -Wl,muldefs' option,
it won't help in this case.

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping the journal (log)
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space)

3.9 HFS+
========

Support: using the unofficial library from 'hfsplus'.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'hfsplus' package.  Go to
     <https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archive/primary/+files/hfsplus_1.0.4.orig.tar.gz>
     to get it.  Before compiling, apply the patch:

     'patch -F10 -p1 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/hfsplus-1.0.4.diff'

     After compiling, install all the libraries - '*.a' - and ALL the
     header files - '*.h' - from the 'libhfsp/src/' directory where the
     C compiler can find them (or put the correct '-I' and '-L' options
     in the compiler flags).

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: OCFS,  Prev: HFS+,  Up: Filesystems support

3.10 OCFS
=========

Support: using the library from 'ocfs2-tools'.

   Compiling requirements:
   * the 'ocfs2-tools' series 1.6.x package (other version also work,
     but disable wiping undelete data in such case).  Go to
     <http://oss.oracle.com/projects/ocfs2-tools/>
     to get it.  Then compile and install that package.

     If you're having trouble compiling, try to apply the patch first:
     'patch -F10 -p1 <
     /path/to/wipefreespace-XX/patches/ocfs2-tools-1.6.4-compile-fix.diff'

   Operations:
   * wiping the free space
   * wiping free space in partially used blocks
   * wiping deleted files' names (if the library works)
   * wiping deleted files' data (part of free space or partially used
     blocks)
   * wiping the journal (log)

4.1 KDE
=======

To use WipeFreeSpace in KDE, download and install FMSec
(https://fmsec.sourceforge.io), a set of extensions to file managers
that enable some security-related operations to be easily performed
(formerly: KonqSec/Konq4Sec/Konq5Sec).

   The *.desktop files previously bundled with WipeFreeSpace are
considered deprecated.

4.2 Xfce
========

To use WipeFreeSpace in Xfce, download and install FMSec
(https://fmsec.sourceforge.io), a set of extensions to file managers
that enable some security-related operations to be easily performed
(formerly: KonqSec/Konq4Sec/Konq5Sec).


File: wipefreespace.info,  Node: Command line syntax and options,  Prev: Xfce,  Up: Usage

4.3 Command line syntax and options
===================================

Basic syntax is:

   'wipefreespace [options] /dev/XY [...]'

   The '/dev/XY' part stands for a device with a supported file system.
Examples: '/dev/hda1', '/dev/fd0'.  More than one device can be given on
the command line, but they will be wiped sequentially, *NOT* in multiple
threads.  WipeFreeSpace is not multithreaded and probably won't be,
because the libraries used can be not thread-safe and the program can't
tell if a library will be used until it's used.

   But, you can run multiple WipeFreeSpace processes (just not wiping
the same filesystem) in multiple terminals (or under screen/nohup) as a
substitute for multi-threading.

   Each given filesystem is wiped *ONLY ONCE*, no matter how many times
it appears on the command line.

   WipeFreeSpace also works for file systems created inside regular
files on any host file system.

   *NOTE*: It is best to use this program on un-mounted file systems,
which makes sure the journal is committed.

   *NOTE*: If a block is damaged, it is only wiped until the first
error.  There is no guarantee that it will be fully wiped.

   Options:

'--all-zeros'
     Use only zeros for wiping.

'--background'
     Continue work in the background, if possible.  This disables
     verbose mode.

'-b superblock_offset'
'--superblock superblock_offset'
     Superblock offset on the given filesystems (usually detected
     automatically).

'-B block_size'
'--blocksize block_size'
     Block size on the given filesystems (usually detected
     automatically).

'-f'
'--force'
     Forces the program to do its job even when the file system has
     errors.

'-h'
'--help'
     Print help and exit.

'--last-zero'
     Perform additional wiping with zeros.

'-l'
'--license'
'--licence'
     Print license information and exit.

'--method <name>'
     Use the given method for wiping (read below).

'-n NNN'
'--iterations NNN'
     Number of passes (must be greater than 0).  This is also the number
     of patterns (including random) used to wipe the free space.

'--nopart'
     Do *NOT* wipe free space in partially used blocks.

'--nounrm'
     Do *NOT* wipe undelete information.

'--nowfs'
     Do *NOT* wipe free space on file system.

'--no-wipe-zero-blocks'
     Do *NOT* wipe all-zero blocks on file system (useful for
     virtual/sparse devices, where empty areas are read as all-zeros and
     do not take physical space unless actually written to).

'--use-dedicated'
     Use the program dedicated for the given filesystem type if
     supported.  Fallback to WipeFreeSpace if unsupported (currently,
     only 'ntfswipe' is supported)

'--use-ioctl'
     Disable device caching during work (can be *DANGEROUS*). This
     requires the 'fcntl.h' header file and the 'ioctl()' function to be
     present.  *NOTE*: this may not work for sub-partitions on drives.
     To disable the cache, run the 'hdparm' utility with the correct
     options to disable the cache before running 'wipefreespace' and
     enable the cache afterwards.

'-v'
'--verbose'
     Enables verbose output.  The program will tell what it's doing.
     Use twice for more.  This also enables progress bars, but be
     warned: these may not always be accurate or increase at a constant
     rate.

'-V'
'--version'
     Print version number and exit.

   The following method names (case-insensitive) are available:
   * Gutmann (method similar to Gutmann's, the default, 36 passes)
   * random (shred-like, 25 passes)
   * schneier (Shneier's method, 7 passes, contains ITSG-06)
   * dod (DoD, 3 passes, contains NAVSO P-5239-26 and German Federal
     Office for Information Security)

   *NOTE*: wiping with just one pattern at a time ('-n 1') will *NOT*
perform wiping with all patterns of the given method one by one, it will
always use the first pattern.  However, it will be *MUCH* faster than
any "full" method.  If you need just random wiping, run

   'wipefreespace -n 1 /dev/XY'

   a few times in a row.

   *NOTE*: All three options '--nopart', '--nounrm', '--nowfs' must
*NOT* be given at once.  This would mean that no work must be done and
the program will exit with "Bad/missing command line syntax" error code.

   *NOTE*: Any option affects all filesystems given on the command line,
not just the ones following it.

   To perform a command after wiping (like sending e-mail), simply run a
program after WipeFreeSpace is finished, for example:

   'wipefreespace [options] /dev/XY; mail [options]'

   or in a script:

	#!/bin/bash
	wipefreespace [options] /dev/XY
	mail [options]

   To run WipeFreeSpace with a higher or lower priority, simply use the
'renice' utility, for example:

   'renice +1 $(pidof wipefreespace)'

5 Return values
***************

The WipeFreeSpace program can return any of the following values:

   * 0: All actions on the last file system succeeded (no errors).
   * 1: Only version number, help or licence information was requested
     and printed, no action.
   * -1: Bad/missing command line syntax.
   * -2: Unable to check if the file system is mounted.  Cannot
     continue.
   * -3: The file system was mounted in read-write mode.  Cannot
     continue.
   * -4: Unable to open the file system.
   * -5: Unable to read block bitmap from the file system (thus, unable
     to determine, which blocks are unused).
   * -6: Memory allocation failed.
   * -7: The file system contained errors and the option '--force' was
     not given.
   * -8: Closing the file system failed.
   * -9: Opening i-node scan failed.  Thus, the program was unable to
     wipe free space in partially used blocks.
   * -10: Iterating over blocks failed.  Thus, the program was unable to
     wipe free space in partially used blocks.
   * -11: I-node read failed.  Some undelete data may not have been
     removed.
   * -12: Directory iterating failed.  Thus, the program was unable to
     remove some of (maybe all) undelete data.
   * -13: The program found out that it has the suid permission bit set
     and the owner is root.  Read the first chapter of this
     documentation for an explanation and a solution.
   * -14: Flushing the changes to the filesystem failed.
   * -15: Block writing failed.
   * -16: Failed to open an attribute (mostly on NTFS).
   * -17: Failed runlist on NTFS.
   * -18: Getting name failed.
   * -19: Context error (NTFS).
   * -20: Bad parameter was passed to one of the functions.
   * -21: Pipe error (mostly XFS).
   * -22: Fork error (XFS, ReiserFSv3 or NTFS).
   * -23: Exec error (XFS).
   * -24: Seek error (mostly ReiserFSv4).
   * -25: Block reading failed.
   * -26: I/O control command (ioctl) failed.
   * -100: A signal was caught and the program was forced to exit.
   * 128+N: The program was terminated by signal number N (the signal
     either wasn't caught or was caught after SIGCONT was received).

   *NOTE*: Actually, the negative values are subtracted from 256, so -1
could turn up as 255, -2 as 254 and so on.

   *NOTE*: Only the last error is returned.  If the last file system was
wiped successfully, but the previous weren't, the last error will be
returned, but not the previous ones.

6 Signals
*********

The program will terminate normally (that is: will flush and close the
file system and release memory) if any of the following signals (if
available during compiling) are caught: SIGINT ('Ctrl+C'), SIGQUIT,
SIGILL, SIGABRT, SIGFPE, SIGSEGV, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1,
SIGUSR2, SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, SIGBUS, SIGPOLL, SIGPROF, SIGSYS, SIGTRAP,
SIGXCPU, SIGXFSZ, SIGPWR, SIGVTALRM, SIGUNUSED, SIGEMT, SIGLOST.

   If the program is still working despite sending a signal (like when
the program is stuck because of filesystem problems), sending any of
these signals again kills the child process (the wiping process) and
exits the main program.

   The SIGCHLD signal is caught, but doesn't terminate the program.

   If the program receives the SIGKILL signal, it will, of course, be
killed.  But it won't be able to close the file system and finish
working normally.  The file system being worked on could be left in an
inconsistent state, errors could show up.  Try to avoid stopping the
program this way.

   You can freeze the program by sending the SIGSTOP signal (like
'killall -STOP wipefreespace') to it or by pressing 'Ctrl+Z' in the
terminal on which the program is running.  The program will continue if
it receives the SIGCONT signal (like with 'killall -CONT
wipefreespace').  You can still send other signals to it, if you wish to
terminate it.

   *NOTE*: for signal handling to work, your compiler probably needs a
working 'volatile' data type.  If you are using GCC, no worries.

10.1 GNU General Public License
===============================

                         Version 2, June 1991

     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if
you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
===============================================================

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
     Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
          all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
     to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
     when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
     work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
     the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
     extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
     regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
     volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
     work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
     or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
     on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
     that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License
     to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
     to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
     restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
     herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
     parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
     copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
     from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
     it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
     terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
     specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
     version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
     the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                              NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
     OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
     LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
     FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
     PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
     DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
     OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=======================================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) YYYY  NAME OF AUTHOR

     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.

     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.

     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) YEAR NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.

10.2 GNU Free Documentation License
===================================

                      Version 1.2, November 2002

     Copyright (C) 2000,2001,2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
     so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.
